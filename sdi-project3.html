    <h2>Project 3</h2>

<article>
<p> In this project I go through some possible dialogue between myself and my band mates regarding our collective guest lists for various shows, venue information, club owner contact information and staffing issues.</p>
<p>Generally a band gets a set amount of guests that each member can get into the club free of charge. We also are tasked with bringing people in the door so occasionally we might give the venue a heads up if we're expecting a large turn out.</p>
